1. Description: 

This program contains the basic functions of a linked list, resembling the linked list container from the STL library. This program contains the following functions: 

*Adds nodes through push_back and push_front functions
*Add nodes at a specified index through the insert function
	You must specify a valid index value, while inserting (cannot exceed the last index location)
*Count the number of prime numbers in the linked list through the prime function 
*Sort linked list in ascending and descending orders (with merge sort) through the sort_ascending and sort_descending functions
*Clear memory and delete nodes through the clear function 

2. Instructions:

	1. Extract the tar file 
	2. Compile the program using the "make" command 
	3. Run the program with "valgrind assign5_app" 
	4. Follow the instructions of the program 

3. Notes: 

*There is no error handling present in this program, you must follow the instructions explicitly in order to guarantee the program will do what it says 
*For the implementation of the merge sort function, the following references were used for the code:

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-sort-for-linked-list/ (used for mergesort)
